Regular readers will notice that I haven't updated this blog in a third of a year. Magical Monkey Adventure has remained frozen in time with nary an update in sight. The obvious question is just what I've been up to over the past couple months. Well...

<!-- more -->

The obvious thing first: College! I started my second semester at Georgia Tech in January, and I'm having a great time. Discrete Math is probably the most fun I've ever had in a math class. Been getting a lot of walking around campus done, too. Healthy living and all that.

Second: I've been working on this project:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Announcing Rune Search, led by William Martin!<br><br>Rune Search is a half word search, half roguelike web game where players must strategically maneuver their way around levels in order to save the princess or kill the monster or get the gold or something.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamedev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gamedev</a> <a href="https://t.co/Hkb2kb1GoI">pic.twitter.com/Hkb2kb1GoI</a></p>&mdash; VGDev (@VGDevGT) <a href="https://twitter.com/VGDevGT/status/1095080238403538944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I've been writing code and music for _Rune Search_, a game that's half word search, half roguelike. It's been a ton of fun. I can't really show you my programming work, but I can show you all the music I've written for it.

College, VGDev, and social stuff have been taking up most of my time, hence the lack of posts here. But! Going forward, I'd like to post more regularly here, at least once a week or so. I've got some ideas for how to keep this place lively and interesting. If nothing else, it'll be fun. (And yes, Magical Monkey Adventure will be completed. My goal's by the end of the semester, but I'm not confident I'll hit that goal.)

So! Thus ends my hiatus. See you tomorrow with a fun little diversion.

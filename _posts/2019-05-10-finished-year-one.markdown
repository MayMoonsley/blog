It's been a week since I finished my first year of college, so I thought it'd be good to summarize what I've been up to.

## Academics

College is a really good place to go to learn things! I know how Dijkstra's algorithm works, I know how to project vectors onto other vectors, and I know what a proof by induction is. I learned a lot this year, and I'm really excited for next semester's classes.

## VGDev

I got involved with [VGDev](https://twitter.com/VGDevGT/), Georgia Tech's video game development club! Last semester I did a bunch of programming work on [Rune Search](https://willbmartin.github.io/rune-search/), a word search roguelike that I also wrote the soundtrack for. I also wrote some music for Hengliding, a delightful combination of a farming sim and racing game I wish I could link to.

## Other Projects

I'm still writing music and working on my own personal projects -- _Magical Monkey Adventure_ is still under development! It's gone through a complete overhaul, but I'm happy with where it's at so far. The plan is to have it done before I go back to school in August, which seems doable.

## Friends

Belaboring this point feels either too schmaltzy or too much like bragging, but I've made friends! As someone who does most of her socializing online, it would've been easy to become a shut-in, but I'm glad I didn't. Making time for my social life is not a decision I regret. To all my friends, online and off, new and old: I love y'all.

## Summary

I learned a lot, I wrote some music and code that I'm proud of, and generally I'm feeling pretty good. I'm excited for what the future will bring.

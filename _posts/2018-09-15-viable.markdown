Welcome to the new blog! After years away from WordPress, I've finally come back to it. It's just so much _easier_; I'm a college student now, and messing around with my FTP stuff whenever I want to post to my blog is a bit much. I've got classes to go to!

I'm leaving [the old blog](http://maycod.es/blog/index.html) up for posterity's sake. (The post on why I abandoned WordPress for static HTML didn't age well, did it? I almost wish I had finished it, just so I could know what I was thinking back then.)

This post is just an announcement - "Hey guys, I'm still here!" - so I don't have anything else to say. Expect more here in the future - I'm working on a couple things right now, so I'm sure I'll end up having _something_ to talk about.

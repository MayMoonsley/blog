Remember I [switched to Wordpress](http://www.maycod.es/blog/2018/09/15/viable/) from raw HTML? I've come to the conclusion that may have been an overcorrection. It's easier than the FTP method, but there's a lot of overhead to it. When I decided to switch to GitHub Pages, it seemed good to switch the blog over, too. Now the blog's powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). [The blog's also open source](https://github.com/MayMoonsley/blog/), which I'm sure is good for something.

This may be a honeymoon period, but I'm a big fan of Jekyll so far. LaTeX support was a lot easier to set up than I imagine it would've been on WordPress, which is very exciting. Support for inline code snippets is also really great. $$ x^2 + x + 1$$ and `foo()` look so much better than x^2 + x + 1 and foo().

It's really nice having the new site up on the right URL. Expect more here soon - I've been working on some interesting things I'm excited to share.
